        It was printed in 
        8 parts
        4 from the Old Testament, 
        1 from the New Testament
        3 with commentary
        The text was in 5 languages: 
        Latin
        Greek
        Hebrew
        Chaldean
        Syriac. 
        A truly monumental masterpiece, commissioned by King Philip II himself. 
        Sign here as 
        King Philip II to continue
      </p>
      <p>
        Only 1,200 copies were made, each intended for influential figures like the Pope and the King of Spain. In the 16th-century Netherlands, books like this were not just tools of knowledge, they were instruments of power and influence. 
        The Biblia Polyglotta also symbolized the Catholic Church's intellectual and cultural authority during the Counter-Reformation, reinforcing its dominance through scholarly and artistic excellence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Impossible! The Biblia Polyglotta weighs 48 kilograms, how could something so monumental fit in your hand? This giant work, like my others, made knowledge more accessible. Imagine such a creation in your tiny phone!
        Ah, you carry that remarkable 'phone' in your hand but let‚Äôs see what I have in mine.

        These blocks were the soul of his illustrations, carved with meticulous care to bring entire books to life.
      How many woodblocks do you think they have in the museum? 
      We have over 14000 blocks featuring botanical drawings, scientific diagrams, decorative initials, and intricate religious scenes. 
      </p>
      <p>This extraordinary collection, preserved at the Plantin-Moretus Museum, showcases a significant contribution to 16th-century publishing and art, including works by renowned botanists like Dodoens, Clusius, and Lobelius.</p>

    <div class="timeline">
      <h2>1960</h2>
      <p>In the 1960s, the woodblocks were systematically cataloged, with their printed images compiled into five volumes previously accessible only in the museum's reading room. However, earlier treatments with toxic anti-woodworm products posed preservation challenges, limiting physical access.</p>
      <h2>Now</h2>
      <p>Today, the digitized collection ensures these historical treasures can be admired without handling risks, preserving their legacy for future generations. These blocks, the foundation of 16th-century publishing, continue to inspire globally. Now digitized, they are celebrated through webinars, events, and initiatives like #WoodblockWednesday. Visitors can delve into their intricate beauty and historical significance through the Plantin-Moretus Museum's exhibitions and online database.

    <div class="music">
      <p>I already answered some things now I have a question for you ...how does music sound nowadays?
        Because when I printed Octo Missae , 
        music was like this.
      </p>
    <h2> The first musical work printed by Plantin‚Äôs press</h2>
      <p>Contains eight Mass settings. Four for five voices, and two each for six and seven voices.
  The publication was massive, measuring 55 by 40 cm, designed so all choir singers could read it together.</p>
  <p>To bring it to life, he used the 'Grande musique' type set from Hendrik van den Keere, a master type founder from Ghent. He supplied Plantin with 44 sets of punches and matrices, including those for music printing. 
  This collaboration made Antwerp a center for music publishing during his time.</p>
  <h2>Did you know that Octo Missae was composed by Georges de la H√®le? </h2>
  <p>
  He was a brilliant composer whose work flourished despite much of it being lost in a fire later. 
  The equipment he used for music printing, preserved today, shows just how much care went into every note and letter.</p>
